# Personal-Portfolio

Hello Everyone!

This is a very simple portfolio project which I have build using HTML, CSS and javascript.

This is a multipage website which includes sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects and contact section. This website is my resume in the form of website.

In the contact section, you can type your name, email id and drop a message and if you hit submit button then it reaches to me via an excel sheet.

I have hosted this website using cloudflare website which allows users to freely host their website on the internet.
